# Propositions as Types: Some Missing Links

I've recently started studying Topology, which turned out to be a topic filled with set theory and theorems around it. Unfortunately, my brain was well-poisoned by Type Theory by the time I've started, so I couldn't help  but itch my hands in attempt of encoding things in Type Theory.

In this blog post, I will list the things I consider missing (or rarely mentioned) when people are talking about Propositions-as-Types with regards to proving set theory theorems in Type Theory, and will show a simple proof of a theorem from the book "Topology Without Tears", one merely about Topology but rather a set-theoretic exercise in proofs.

## The Missing Links

List of things I don't see mentioned very often:

**Equality of Sets**. If sets are types, then what would their equality look like? I think there are two options here: first is to use the notion of Isomorphism, the second is to assume Univalence and get equality-via-isomorphism "for free". In this post's example, I'll take the former approach. So if we are required to prove that sets `A` and `B` are equal, we will be building an element of type `A ‚âÉ B`. Just to remind ourselves what an Isomorphism is. For some types `A` and `B`, an isomorphism between them is defined as:

```agda
record _‚âÉ_ (...) where
  field
    to   : A ‚Üí B
    from : B ‚Üí A
    from‚àòto : ‚àÄ (x : A) ‚Üí from (to x) ‚â° x
    to‚àòfrom : ‚àÄ (y : B) ‚Üí to (from y) ‚â° y
```

An Isomorphism is a record of four fields:

- a function taking us from `A` to `B`
- a function bringing us backwards
- an element of type `from (to x) ‚â° x`, proving that if we go from `A` to `B` and back using our implementation, we'd get the same element we started from
- and a similar law `to (from y) ‚â° y` going the other direction

So, for example, we could then provide an isomorphism between numbers and their string representations via encoding them as Roman Numbers.

**Subsets**. There are actually two distinct approaches I've encountered with regard to subsets, and we're going to use both. One is a.k.a. the HoTT book, Chapter 3.5, encoding a subset of some set `A` of elements satisfying some predicate `P` (`{ x ‚àà A | P(x)}`) as:
$$
\Sigma_{x : A}P(x)
$$
So, a type describing a pair of element `x : A` and a proof that that element satisfies some predicate `P` is describing all the values which are members of this subset.

```agda
-- Btw to not confuse sets and types, we'll use Type‚ÇÄ and Type‚ÇÅ
-- instead of the usual Agda's `Set` and `Set‚ÇÅ` types

-- Type of some predicate
Pred : Type‚ÇÄ ‚Üí Type‚ÇÅ
Pred X = X ‚Üí Type‚ÇÄ

-- Type of a subset
Subset : ‚àÄ {X : Type‚ÇÄ} ‚Üí Pred X ‚Üí Type‚ÇÄ
Subset {X} P = Œ£[ x ‚àà X ] (P x)

-- To those who don't remember, in the syntax Œ£[ x ‚àà X ] (P x)
-- the symbol `‚àà` essentially means "has type". So it reads
-- "for some x that has type X, there exists an element of `P x`"
```

The second notion that I was thinking about was to use the notion of Embedding, something very much like Isomorphism, but without one law:

```agda
record _‚â≤_ (A B : Type‚ÇÄ) : Type‚ÇÄ where
  field
    to      : A ‚Üí B
    from    : B ‚Üí A
    from‚àòto : ‚àÄ (x : A) ‚Üí from (to x) ‚â° x
```

So, for example, we can prove the embedding of `Bool`s to `Nat`s by saying that `True` will map to `1` and `False` will map to `0`. Then `to(from(x)) ‚â° x` will hold for both, `x` being `True` or `False`, but the opposite `from(to(x))` would clearly fail for anything `> 1` (`from(to(3)) ‚â° 1`).

**Set of subsets.** An interesting one to crack to me was the notion of a "set of subsets" back from when I've studied what a Topology is. So, if a subset is a pair of element of `X` and a proof that it satisfies some predicate `P`, then set of subsets must be a pair of *some predicate describing a subset* and an instance of a *predicate on that predicate*:

```agda
PredOnPred : Type‚ÇÄ ‚Üí Type‚ÇÅ
PredOnPred X = (X ‚Üí Type‚ÇÄ) ‚Üí Type‚ÇÄ

SetOfSubs : {X : Type‚ÇÄ} ‚Üí (PredOnPred X) ‚Üí Type‚ÇÅ
SetOfSubs {X} ‚Ñô = Œ£[ P ‚àà Pred X ] (‚Ñô P)
```

I don't know the usefullness of this to be honest, but for our purposes it seems ok and doesn't look wrong.

**Set belonging to a Set of Subsets**

How do we say that something is present in a given set of subsets? Probably give back the predicate and show all elements satisfying it are isomorphic to S

```agda
_‚ààs_ : {X : Type‚ÇÄ}
     ‚Üí {‚Ñô : PredOnPred X}
     ‚Üí (S : Type‚ÇÄ) ‚Üí (SetOfSubs ‚Ñô) ‚Üí Type‚ÇÅ
_‚ààs_ {X} S ‚Ñô =
  Œ£[ P ‚àà Pred X ]
  ( ‚àÄ (x : X) ‚Üí (P x ‚âÉ S))
```

**Unions, Intersections. Finite and Infinite.**. The first thing that you see when you study Topology is that a Topology has a property involving Unions and Intersections, and not just that, but they're also finite and infinite.

First, let's deal with infinite ones. They are well-known in Type Theory, and are represented as a Sum type ("or") and a Product type ("and"). So:

```agda
-- This is a Union of A and B: A ‚äé B

-- This is an Intersection of A and B: A √ó B
```

Now, but what does it take to be an infinite union? Well, if you look not at what an infinite union is exactly, but at [what you can do with it](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Union_(set_theory)#Arbitrary_unions), you'll find that the only useful thing is this:
$$
x \in \bigcup \mathbf{M} \iff \exists A \in \mathbf{M},\ x \in A
$$
E.g. to say that x is in some union is the same thing as to say that there exists an element of that union which x belongs to. Great!

Now, for the purposes I've had, I've needed a union of specifically some set of subsets, so I've enriched the notion just mentioned with an additional fact that whatever the element of the union we cat, it's going to be a subset of that set.

```agda
Union : {X : Type‚ÇÄ}
      ‚Üí {‚Ñô : PredOnPred X}
      ‚Üí (J : Type‚ÇÄ)
      ‚Üí (ùêµ : SetOfSubs ‚Ñô)
      ‚Üí Type‚ÇÅ
Union J ùêµ =
  Œ£[ j ‚àà J ]
  Œ£[ B‚±º ‚àà Type‚ÇÄ ]
  (B‚±º ‚ààs ùêµ)
```

So we say that `J` is some "index set" on our type `X`, and that a union (somewhat resembling the notion of a subset) is a triple of a specific index, a type for a subset at that index, and a proof that it's a subset of `ùêµ`.

## Let's Have Some Fun Now

I'd like us to stop now with the code snippets describing all that useless conceptual code and do something practical! Let's prove a proposition now. It's going to be an arbitrary-chosen Proposition 2.3.2 from the book [Topology Without Tears](http://www.topologywithouttears.net/). Here it is, together with its "unwrapping" and the proof:

![prop232_1](./propositions-as-types-missing-links/prop232_1.png)

![prop232_1](./propositions-as-types-missing-links/prop232_2.png)

![prop232_1](./propositions-as-types-missing-links/prop232_3.png)

We're only going to bother ourselves with the second part of the proof, the "Conversely" one. The first part is left to the reader as an exercise.

To visualise what we're doing here, here's a fine drawing of mine:

![prop232_drawing](./propositions-as-types-missing-links/prop232_drawing.jpg)

The proof goes by saying that since for every `x` in `U` we see that it's also in some `B ‚äÜ U`, then obviously `U` is eqal to a union of all such `B`s. That's exactly what we're going to encode.

I'm going to just throw the code at you here, and then explain few things that were missing from before, and few places I've had to struggle with the most.

TODO:

- "Dynamic Membership Checking". Proofs in set theory often go on and say "if x is a member of X then ...". I'm not touching examples of these proofs here, but I think this should be mentioned explicitly. Most situation like this either translate in a "there exists an `x : X`", or involve the Law of Excluded Middle
- Sameness of an element. It's often said that "if an element x is a member if U, it's also a member of V", but if U and V are distinct types, `x` can't have both types. In Type Theory, this has to have a bit more structure. For example, 
- union truncation
- the need for levels in isomorphism definition
- rename Set to Type
