# Kyiv Elm Study Group Experience Report

Last Thursday was our last Study Group meeting. It was an interesting, short experment, which would hopefully bring Kyiv's Elm community to life.

### Scope

We began on February 28, and the course took seven weeks overall. We went through [Elm in Action](https://www.manning.com/books/elm-in-action) book by Richard Feldman, one chapter a week, composing our own set of exercises. The program can be seen at [course's info page](https://github.com/KyivHaskell/elm-study-group#%D1%80%D0%BE%D0%B7%D0%BA%D0%BB%D0%B0%D0%B4) (some more edits planned).

TODO/Outline:

- [x] short emotional impression. "experiment"

- [x] when we began, scope, length
- [ ] Logo
- [ ] initial worries and plans:
  - lack of homework
  - Read "Elm in Action" initially, wasn't a good fit (but a nice book overall)
  - Book being young (and not finished actually)
  - emphasis on practice but not too much in theory, might make false impression of progress
  - planned to be a gateway drug to Haskell course
- [ ] photo
- [ ] meetup.events
- [ ] advanced materials not covered well, but served as a nice "talk" fill
- [ ] outcomes:
  - Elm seems to be a much better language than Haskell for beginners: no type classes, concise stdlib/core, specialized operation types, nice error messages. "Special" three type-classes only
  - keep it short
  - make an intro with ADT, Lists, recursion etc.
  - SPA homework would better be merged in one project that continues being developed instead of new project every week
  - some tasks too hard (like mark Graceful Labeling from week 3), gathering good homework is hard
  - JSON combinators aren't easy, esp pipelining, need better tutorials. good decision to implement our own as a homework
- [ ] personal satisfaction
