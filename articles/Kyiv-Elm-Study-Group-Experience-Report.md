# Kyiv Elm Study Group Experience Report

TODO/Outline:

- [ ] short emotional impression. "experiment"

- [ ] when we began, scope, length
- [ ] initial worries:
  - lack of homework
  - Book being young (and not finished actually)
  - emphasis on practice but not too much in theory, might make false impression of progress
- [ ] photo
- [ ] meetup.events
- [ ] advanced materials not covered
- [ ] outcomes:
  - keep it short
  - make an intro with ADT, Lists, recursion etc.
  - SPA homework would better be merged in one project that continues being developed instead of new project every week
  - some tasks too hard (like mark Graceful Labeling from week 3), gathering good homework is hard
- [ ] personal satisfaction
- [ ] Thank:
